## Summary

<br>

- This paper proposes a novel method that builds on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
- ABC + Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) + Graph Lasso
- Overcome the high-dimensional problem in ABC
- Capture the relationship in summary stats and parameters

<br>

- Simulations to show better performance over Gaussian Copula [@li2017extending]
- Smaller bias over frequentist method (SMM) in DSGE model

## Questions and Comments

<br>

1. What is the economic interpretation of correlation between parameters?
    - E.g. what does it mean if household's preference is correlated with the rate of depreciation?
    - Adds to the main contribution
    - Convince researchers to use the proposed method

<br>

2. How is the standard error calculated?
    - After Lasso selection, the standard errors are usually incorrect
    - The tuning algorithm is more frequentist-based
    - Correct standard errors can be obtained if the tuning parameter is part of the posterior, like the Bayesian Lasso [@park2008bayesian]

## Questions and Comments

<br>

3. The target journal/readers
    - Maker decisions on how to set up the motivation and simulations
    - If target Bayesian, the current content seems intact
    - If target Fequentist as well, 
      - The motivating example may lack applications in economics
      - High-dimension is usually not a problem in DSGE, but joint identification/nonlinearity is

<br>

4. Minor comment on the presentation, <br> less terminology and more intuition would be appreciated by general audience
